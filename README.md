# module_1_final_projectREADME.md

  For this project, I collected and analyzed historical data regarding the movie industry through webscraping. I focused on a sample of the top 25 movies per domestic gross profit of box office sales every year for the past 5 years (2015-2019). I, also, found current data (YTD) which I used to formulate my recommendations and projections for future goals and overall business strategy.
